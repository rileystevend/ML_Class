# ML Class

This repo is to share information about ML resources, notebooks, etc. 
Most of the information will be from [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) textbook, which utilizes R for its labs and assignments. However, if you prefer Python, [this github repo](https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/ISLR-python) has all of the code written in Python. 

Once we have covered the basics through the ISL book, the followup textbook is [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn//)

## Scope 

In order to fully comprehend what is going on with these Machine Learning Models, there are a few topics we are going to have to skim before we start jumping into how the algorithms work. According to map below, from [Swami Chandrasekaran](http://nirvacana.com/thoughts/2013/07/08/becoming-a-data-scientist/), Data Science/Machine Learning has a lot of dependencies.
